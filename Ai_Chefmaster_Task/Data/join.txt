INNER JOIN (Returns matching records in both tables)
Find all students along with their professor details
SELECT 
    s.student_num, s.student_fname, s.student_lname, s.stu_email, s.dept_code,
    p.prof_num, p.prof_fname, p.prof_lname, p.prof_email, p.prof_specialty
FROM Student s
INNER JOIN Professor p ON s.prof_num = p.prof_num;

LEFT JOIN (Returns all students, even if they don’t have an assigned professor)
List all students and their professors (if assigned), showing NULL where missing

SELECT 
    s.student_num, s.student_fname, s.student_lname, s.stu_email, s.dept_code,
    p.prof_num, p.prof_fname, p.prof_lname, p.prof_email
FROM Student s
LEFT JOIN Professor p ON s.prof_num = p.prof_num;

RIGHT JOIN (Returns all professors, even if they don’t have students)
List all professors and their assigned students (if any)

SELECT 
    s.student_num, s.student_fname, s.student_lname, s.stu_email, s.dept_code,
    p.prof_num, p.prof_fname, p.prof_lname, p.prof_email
FROM Student s
RIGHT JOIN Professor p ON s.prof_num = p.prof_num;

 FULL OUTER JOIN (Returns all students and all professors, even if no match exists)
SELECT 
    s.student_num, s.student_fname, s.student_lname, s.stu_email, s.dept_code,
    p.prof_num, p.prof_fname, p.prof_lname, p.prof_email
FROM Student s
FULL OUTER JOIN Professor p ON s.prof_num = p.prof_num;

 CROSS JOIN (Returns all possible combinations of students and professors)
SELECT 
    s.student_num, s.student_fname, s.student_lname, 
    p.prof_num, p.prof_fname, p.prof_lname
FROM Student s
CROSS JOIN Professor p;

SELF JOIN (If needed for relationships within the same table)
For example, if professors have mentors, you can join the Professor table to itself:
SELECT 
    p1.prof_num AS professor_1_id, p1.prof_fname AS professor_1_name, 
    p2.prof_num AS professor_2_id, p2.prof_fname AS professor_2_name,
    p1.dept_code
FROM Professor p1
JOIN Professor p2 
    ON p1.dept_code = p2.dept_code  -- Professors in the same department
    AND p1.prof_num <> p2.prof_num; -- Avoid pairing the same professor
