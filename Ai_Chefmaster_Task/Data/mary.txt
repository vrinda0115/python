Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
It followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
Followed her to school one day
Which was against the rules
It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
Made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school
And so, the teacher turned it out
Turned it out, turned it out
So the teacher turned it out
But still, it lingered near
And waited patiently, patiently, patiently
Waited patiently 'til Mary did appear
Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
